# CrewComms

[My Notes](notes.md)

My startup application's purpose is to make things easier for managers/supervisors and employees in mainly part-time working environments (food industry, grocery stores, retail, etc). This could involve many tools, including organized lists for maintenance issues, general announcements, employee training trackers, and complaint forms. My focus will be on the first two (maintenance and announcements) to make communication between managers and employees more clear on a day-to-day basis in the workplace. 

Managers will create a page/group for their business location, and would be the admin to adjust settings and how overall admin roles for the group. They can give other employees varying levels of access and control depending on their roles.The app will allow people to submit maintenance requests, allowing managers and authorized employees to see them, make them know to other employees as needed, and update the status of the requests in real time so everyone is in the loop. Pictures could be included as well.

> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Anyone who's worked a part-time job at a restaurant, retail store, or local grocer can relate to frustrations at work. Even in great work environments, simple things fall through the cracks due to poor communication between employees and managers. CrewComms's purpose is to fill in those cracks. With one, simple app managers can keep track of the day-to-day updates in the workplace without having to dig through hundreds of emails. As managers update maintenance concerns, general announcements, and key reminders, employees can stay in the loop without having to ask the same questions over and over again. Managers can even authorize trusted employees to make real-time updates the managers might miss since they aren't always on the floor. Make managing easier with CrewComms!

### Design

This is a rough diagram of the key features of the app. Obviously some steps are missing in this process, and the exact way these tools are worked may be changed for convenience to the user.

A rough sketch of the website. The design will be very simple, with clear actions that are easy to understand.

### Key features

- Comprehensive, updating list of workplace maintenance concerns
- General announcements for all employees
- Ability for customers and employees to provide feedback to managers

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - At least 3 pages: 1 for employees to login, 1 dashboard for employees to view, and 1 for customers to submit complaints/issues.
- **CSS** - Making sure sizing is appropriate on different sized screens. using very simple color choices and designs so functionality is readily apparent to users.
- **React** - Login functionality, submitting of complaints/reports, displaying complaints/reports/announcements
- **Service** - Backend support for login, new users, making a group/page for a business, storing of announcements and updates for employees and managers, use of public API https://dummyimage.com/ to get relevant icons for the maintenance issue report page.
- **DB/Login** - All login info for employees will need to be stored, as well as their access levels. Additional, lists of announcments and maintenance reports will be stored.
- **WebSocket** - Real-time updates of the list of maintenance issues and announcements as managers make updates to them.
